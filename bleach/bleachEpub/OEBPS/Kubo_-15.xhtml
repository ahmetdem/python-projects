			<p class="pf"><span class="first">H</span><span class="first">ow much time had passed</span> since Kaname Tosen swore allegiance to Sosuke Aizen? Before Tosen realized it, and unrelated to when he had started serving the man, Tosen had elevated Aizen to the point that the man was an absolute king in his mind.</p>
			<p class="p">The first few years, he remained by Aizen’s side with doubts. Rather, one could even say that he viewed Aizen with hostility, thinking that perhaps he really was a Soul Reaper and a bird of the same feather as Tokinada Tsunayashiro, that there was no mistaking that Aizen claimed to have saved him only to use him as a pawn. While continuing to harbor those doubts, he firmly kept his guard up.</p>
			<p class="p">He also wondered whether perhaps Aizen had recruited him as an ally only because Kyoka Suigetsu did not work on him—but that doubt vanished immediately. If that were the case and Tosen were one of Aizen’s weaknesses, Aizen could have just killed him.</p>
			<p class="p">Sosuke Aizen’s power was so great that he felt embarrassed that he had even had that doubt. The more he learned about Aizen’s power, the more his initial hostility waned. Aizen could not possibly be a bird of the same feather as the Soul Reapers.</p>
			<p class="p">The man had already overcome the limitations of a Soul Reaper, and it could be said he had the fangs to simply make those birds into one of his prey.</p>
			<p class="p">For the same reason, the concern that he would be used as a simple pawn also disappeared. For a man with the genius of Sosuke Aizen, a pawn wouldn’t have made any difference to him. He hadn’t had a reason to save Tosen at the risk of revealing Kyoka Suigetsu’s power.</p>
			<p class="p">When Aizen had tried to compel him there to become a sacrifice for his goals, Tosen tried to stop him by killing him. However, Aizen, who lightly dodged Tosen’s advance, did not even attempt to punish him.</p>
			<p class="p">When Tosen told him to kill him if Aizen were using him, Aizen had said this:</p>
			<p class="p"><span class="i">“Don’t say something you don’t mean. You’re more frightened than anyone else, aren’t you? Not of death, but of not being able to carry out your revenge, and of disappearing without attaining revenge.</span></p>
			<p class="p"><span class="i">“The path I take will likely be paved with many sacrifices. However, leaving the world in the hands of the Soul Reapers like this would be immoral, like turning one’s eyes away from a chain of perpetual sacrifices. Even if everyone else objects, I do not intend to change this theory.</span></p>
			<p class="p"><span class="i">“If you still condemn me, regardless of that, then you might as well sharpen your blade while you’re with me, in order that someday your weapon might reach me.”</span></p>
			<p class="p">After listening to these points, Tosen had asked questions.</p>
			<p class="p"><span class="i">“Why did you take in someone who could become your enemy?”</span></p>
			<p class="p">He asked what he could mean to a man like Aizen, with the grand ambitions Aizen was attempting to achieve.</p>
			<p class="p"><span class="i">“Because you are someone who knows both despair and fear. I have nothing to fear. Nothing perplexes me. However, that is exactly why I need someone to light the way.”</span></p>
			<p class="p">Tosen understood. To Aizen, good and evil were equally unworthy. In order to make the world support his own path, Tosen had seen the man save the world countless times. For the sake of all he desired, Tosen had seen the man purposefully and unscrupulously stand by. Because Aizen had no reason to use good or evil as a reason, he simply grew stronger on his own and did not stray from the path that he had set out on. The path he walked was right, and he would not shy from slaughter for the sake of justice. The justice he spoke of was not at all bound by the duality of good and evil.</p>
			<p class="p">Tosen, who had come to understand the man named Aizen, did not doubt his intentions were any more than that. Regardless, it would have been a lie to claim that all of his hesitations had disappeared.</p>
			<p class="p">He had no doubt regarding Aizen.</p>
			<p class="p">How he acted while walking the road of his ambitions certainly would have been viewed as treason in the world at large. However, knowing that, he was clearing the path with his own two feet for the sake of the justice he believed in.</p>
			<p class="p">In that case, what would become of Tosen?</p>
			<p class="p">Was there a right way of doing things according to his own idea of justice? Did <span class="i">he</span> have a cause?</p>
			<p class="p">Was Kaname Tosen simply taking the path that the powerful Aizen walked in order to get his revenge?</p>
			<p class="p">As though he had seen through that hesitation, Aizen said to Tosen, “It seems you are still undecided.”</p>
			<p class="p">“I just do not know…”</p>
			<p class="p">Though Tosen worried it was disrespectful, he spoke to Aizen of the fear that he had. “Because of that, I am frightened. I hate Soul Reapers. I hate the world where they have their way. But do I have the qualifications to condemn the entire world when I am acting out of a grudge?”</p>
			<p class="p">“That isn’t the case. You and I have no need to judge the world.” Aizen did not deny or affirm Tosen’s fear and continued speaking about the world. “Because the world that exists now was created on top of a sin.”</p>
			<p class="p">“A sin?”</p>
			<p class="p">“However, I do not approve of setting the world back to what was originally, as the founder of the Quincies who invaded the Soul Society in the past wanted. That would take away the significance of people being people. That is exactly why I will bring down the linchpin of the way of the world, the symbol of the Soul Reapers’ sin, the greatest sacrifice—the Soul King in heaven.”</p>
			<p class="p">When Aizen said it that way, Tosen spoke of his doubts about the world. “Lord Aizen, you said that you would bring the Soul King down from heaven and stand there yourself, but why is the Soul Reapers’ king a sacrifice?”</p>
			<p class="p">At Tosen’s question, Aizen spoke a word that Tosen was not familiar with for some reason. “Do you know what a Fullbringer is?”</p>
			<p class="p">“Hm? No… I only have a superficial education, so I apologize.”</p>
			<p class="p">“There’s no need to apologize. If anything, I am the one who should apologize for asking such an unfair question. Even in the Soul Society, those who know of the Fullbringers’ existence number in the few.”</p>
			<p class="p">Aizen then narrowed his eyes and uttered the name of the aristocratic family that tied him and Tosen together. “That is because the Tsunayashiro clan has hidden the information.”</p>
			<p class="p">“What?!”</p>
			<p class="p">Once Tosen had received an explanation of the Full-bringers’ existence, he still could not understand how that was connected to the Soul Society’s sin.</p>
			<p class="p">Expressing that Tosen’s doubt was natural, Aizen began to speak of what had been “before.”</p>
			<p class="p">“Well, why do you think the unborn children’s mothers are attacked in the first place?”</p>
			<p class="p">“Huh? So it’s not by coincidence?”</p>
			<p class="p">Aizen quietly confirmed that, and Tosen the Soul Reaper was surprised.</p>
			<p class="p">“You know that I was shaving away the souls of the people in the Rukongai and offering them to the incomplete Hogyoku, don’t you?”</p>
			<p class="p">“Yes.”</p>
			<p class="p">“With some of them, though they did not satisfy the Hogyoku, it exhibited a very strong reaction. When I researched further I found it reacted to a certain girl whose konpaku I had taken. To be more accurate, it seemed to react to the ‘nail’ that was intermingling in her konpaku.”</p>
			<p class="p">Aizen had continued to research the Hogyoku for a way to bring down the royal palace and put himself in heaven. No matter how many hundreds of souls he fed it, the Hogyoku showed no signs of becoming complete. That was why Aizen wanted the other Hogyoku that Kisuke Urahara had created, but in the process of his research, he had by coincidence noticed the existence of the “nails” and the special abilities of Fullbringers.</p>
			<p class="p">“Although a substantial part of her soul had been stolen, she did not die, and that girl continues to have the qualities of a Soul Reaper even now. It is likely that the ‘nail’ had a certain degree of influence on her. There might have been something other than her qualities as a Soul Reaper that she had lost.”</p>
			<p class="p">“When you speak of ‘nails’…is that a metaphor?”</p>
			<p class="p">“No. I mean a nail.”</p>
			<p class="p">At that point, Aizen smiled boldly and gave an explanation that was beyond what Tosen could have imagined. “A part that had been carved away in the distant past <span class="i">by the ancestors of the Soul Reapers</span>—a part of the Reio’s body.”</p>
			<p class="p">That was how Kaname Tosen came to know about it.</p>
			<p class="p">He found out the truth about how not only the Soul Society, but also the living world and Hueco Mundo—all three worlds—were created.</p>
			<p class="orn">≡</p>
			<p class="p">As soon as he had heard everything that Aizen had to tell, Tosen had been prepared. He was prepared to become a traitor and was convinced that changing the world itself would be justice.</p>
			<p class="p">If it was for this cause, he would not mind throwing his life away. As the hesitation in Tosen’s spiritual pressure disappeared in front of him, Aizen once again told Tosen the path that he himself was taking. “I will eventually reach the horizon of the truth and will replace the linchpin. I will likely stand in heaven, not manipulated by others into becoming a sacrifice, but of my own volition.”</p>
			<p class="p">Aizen then purposefully offered Tosen, a man who had clear determination to serve him, a deal. “Is there anything you wish for, Kaname? I will give you a token of thanks for following me as my most loyal subject. If there is something that you wish for, you may tell me.”</p>
			<p class="p">With words that tested his conviction, Tosen almost started to reply honestly, “My wish is for the world you create, Lord Aizen.” But at that moment the image of his friend, as they spoke on the hill in the Rukongai, came into his mind.</p>
			<p class="p">After remaining silent for a short interval, he slowly opened his mouth to speak. “If you would allow it…I have one wish.”</p>
			<p class="p">“Oh?”</p>
			<p class="p">Aizen himself hadn’t expected Tosen to want something, and he squinted with great interest as he waited for Tosen to continue.</p>
			<p class="p">“What I wish for is—"</p>
